## ğŸ¤– Welcome to my page ğŸ¤–

- ğŸ“‘ I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics.
- ğŸ’­ I've created this page to improve my writing skills and document my journey. For this purpose I have created a small blog called [Thoughts](https://nullsender.github.io/thoughts/), where I'll share write-ups about topics I find interesting.
